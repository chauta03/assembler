Name of the Program: Assembler
Directions of using: Run assembler with a input file. Could turn on 
                    debuging to see more contents of the instructions.
                    - Compile all the files: "make assembler"
                    - To run the program: "./assembler <your MIPS file>"
                    - If you want to turn on debugging enter:
                        "./assembler <your MIPS file> 1"
                        or
                        "./assembler 1 <your MIPS file>"
                    For example: "./assembler Chou.mips 1"
Program purpose: Read MIPS instructions and generate corresponding 
                machine language instructions.

    Reason: Include new version of printAsBinary, testPrintAsBinary
            assembler.h (include checking range for signed and 
            unsigned numbers).
